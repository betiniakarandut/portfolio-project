# Portfolio Project :fire:

## Description :house:

This is my portfolio project at the end of the foundation phase in the ROADMAP to becoming a software engineer.
In this project, I discovered a pressing need amongst the natural gas engineering students and that was calculating static bottom hole pressure of a gas well. So, I took it upon myself to come up with a kind of desktop application that can answer this need but using the SUKKAR and CORNELL integral method. This will be a very user friendly, light weight application.
_Stick up for updates!_

## Files :pencil:
