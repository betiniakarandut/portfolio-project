# Portfolio Project

## Description :house:
This is my portfolio project at the end of the foundation phase in the ROADMAP to becoming a software engineer.
In this project, I discovered a pressing need amongst the natural gas engineering students and that was calculating static bottom hole pressureof a gas well. So, I took it upon myself to come up with a kind of desktop application that can answer this need but using the SUKKAR and CORNELL integral method. This will be a very user friendly, light weight application. Stick up for updates!
